### Implementation Notes
1. Database schema:
   - All migrations are created and ready to run
   - Proper indexes added for performance
   - Relationships established between tables

2. Services:
   - Each service follows single responsibility principle
   - Error handling implemented with proper logging
   - Validation integrated at service level

3. Validation:
   - Comprehensive validation schemas created
   - Custom error messages for better UX
   - Cross-field validations implemented

4. Routes:
   - RESTful endpoints implemented
   - Proper middleware chain setup
   - Error handling middleware in place

5. To run the implementation:
   ```
   1. Run migrations in order
   2. Update validation service to use new schemas
   3. Test endpoints with provided sample data
   ```

### Database Connection Notes
1. Database Configuration:
   - Database name: `stock_market_app`
   - User: `root`
   - Password: (empty)
   - Connection command: `mysql -u root stock_market_app`

2. Database Best Practices:
   - Always use migrations for schema changes
   - Test migrations in development first
   - Keep backup before running migrations
   - Monitor migration results for issues

3. Current Database Status:
   - Database exists and is configured
   - Connection settings in .env file
   - Migrations are versioned and tracked

2. Migration Description:
   ```
   - Task Priorities Update: Adds priority field to tasks
   - Expenses: Creates expense tracking system
   - Financial Goals: Implements savings and financial goals
   - Bank Accounts Update: Adds new fields for account types
   - Standardize Tables: Adds timestamps and UUID to all tables
   - Foreign Keys: Establishes relationships between tables
   ```

3. Running Migrations:
   ```bash
   # Connect to database
   mysql -u root stock_market_app

   # Check migration status
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:status

   # Run pending migrations
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

3. Migration Best Practices:
   - Always backup database before migrations
   - Run in development environment first
   - Check rollback scripts before running
   - Monitor execution time for large migrations

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes added on frequently queried fields
- Bulk operations supported for setup
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Rate limiting applied to all routes
