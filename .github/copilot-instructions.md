we are using Windows;
we are using expressjs as api;
make sure to add db migration scripts if changes are made to the db;

- create todo file instructions:
  - create a todo.md file in the root directory of the project
  - add a list of tasks that need to be done
  - add a list of notes that can help in future
  - add tickmarks for completed tasks
  - do not remove old notes, just add new ones

- while running any db related commands, 
  - use npx sequelize-cli
  - use windows command line. instead of `&&` use `;` for chaining commands.
