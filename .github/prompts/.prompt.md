# Project Overview
Our project focuses on personal finance management and advanced stock analysis.
We have external Express.js API endpoints.
We prefer smaller functions and modular code for consistency.
We also prefer commonly used utilities in our app.
We are using Next.js for our frontend with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN.
Break the tasks into smaller steps and complete them one by one.
Add unit tests for critical functions to ensure reliability and maintainability if requested.
Implement code reviews to enhance code quality and knowledge sharing across the team.

while creating API ROUTES IN ROUTER FILE please refer to the following structure:
```javascript
    router.get('/comparison', auth.isAuthenticated, async (req, res, next) => {
        try {
            // Your code logic here including error handling
        } catch (error) {
            next(error);
        }
    });
